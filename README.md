# TempoFinalProject

This project was a year long collaboration between myself and Kevin Ahn to create both a novel programming language
called Tempo and an IDE specifically designed to run it. The language Tempo is completely unlike any other coding language
in structure. To make Tempo usable, the IDE uses a transpiler from Tempo to Java, relying on a Java package called JFugue
to create the actual sounds from the Java file. The transpiler has all of the functionality expected, including extensive
error checking. The IDE includes a number of features including syntax highlighting and editing commands tailored for the
language. Additionally, there is a help menu that links to a document containing complete and detailed instructions on 
learning the language. Enjoy!

To use Tempo, run the main file. Open one of the .mus files from the project folder and hit Compile & Run.
